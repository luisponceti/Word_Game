# 3.5-wordgame
* In this project I created a hangman game in the browser. I used JavaScript functions, conditionals, loops, arrays and objects to execute the game logic and change the DOM based on application state. There's a link to the app in the repo description, and you can also clone the repo if you'd like to get it working locally.
